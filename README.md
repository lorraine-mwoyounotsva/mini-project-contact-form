# Contact Form

This project is a responsive **Contact Form** webpage built using HTML and CSS. It has modern pastel-themed styling and uses Font Awesome icons for visual enhancement.

## How It Works

- The form contains fields for Name, Email, Phone (optional), Subject, and Message.
- Each input field includes an icon placed inside the input for better UX.
- The form is styled with pastel purples and lilacs for a soft, friendly look.
- On smaller screens, the form adapts gracefully to a single-column layout.
- Contact details (address, email, phone) are shown below the form for quick reference.

## What I Learned

- How to style forms elegantly using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- Positioning icons inside inputs using relative and absolute positioning.
- Designing a visually appealing pastel color palette.
- Responsive design techniques for mobile compatibility.
- Accessibility improvements using proper label associations.
- Use of external icon libraries (Font Awesome) to enhance UI.

This project improved my skills in layout design, color theory, and responsive UI development.
